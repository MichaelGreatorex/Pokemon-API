Intro to Web Development - WYWM training

This is a web application which fetches data from Poke API (https://pokeapi.co)

The data that can be viewed is:
1.  Pokemon Name and ID
2.  Official Artwork
3.  Stats
4.  Shiny image

Data can be fetched either by:

1.  Clicking one of the popular Pokemon names on the buttons in the top header
2.  Typing a Pokemon name or ID into the search bar and clicking GO!
3.  Clicking one of the number buttons at the button for quick access to the 1st Generation of Pokemon

Notes:
1.  The API can fetch data for 1010 different Pokemon characters and these can be searched by name or ID number
2.  Typing a name or number which isn't recognised by the API will draw and error message
